            <p ><big><b>Let's say you have a small fortune</b></big></br>
                of some stocks, a flat or house, several dozen ounces of physical gold, a few hundred ounces of physical silver, as well as two plots of land, a car and a certain amount of several cryptocurrencies, and of course some cash reserves in several currencies.</p>
                <p><b>It's hard to say how much that's worth at any given time,</b></br> because obviously the value of your wealth changes over time during, say, a corona-crash, a bull market in cryptocurrencies, or weakness in the US dollar.</p>
                    <p>In addition, you have domestic and foreign stocks in a total of three brokerage accounts, some bullion buried under your favourite oak tree by the lake, some you have in a safe. Similarly, you have cash in several bank accounts, some in banknotes.</p>
                    <p>In such a situation it is difficult to make a quick assessment of the value of your assets.</br>This is where Treasure Island can help.</p>


            <p><b>Treasure Island is a tool to monitor the value of your wealth consisting of various assets.</b></p>
